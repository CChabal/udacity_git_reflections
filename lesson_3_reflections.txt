-When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I'm working on different computers. Or, usually when I'm collaborating on projects and code with other people such as coworkers etc.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I want to work on my own pace, instead of Git automatically changing my work for me and pulling commits that I'm not ready for.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another.

By cloning you make a copy of a repository which will be saved on your computer. You could also clone repositories locals. Fork has the same function as a clone but it's done remotely. On GitHub to be precise. Branches are basically pointers to a particular series of commits. They can diverge into other commits (branch of) for feature testing for example.
